    <div>
        <p>
          Below are our Terms of Service, which outline a lot of legal goodies, but 
          the bottom line is it’s our aim to always take care of both you, as a customer, 
          or as a seller on our platform. We’ve included many of these terms to legally 
          protect ourselves, but if you have an issue, always feel free to email us and 
          we’ll do our best to resolve it in a fair and timely fashion.
        </p>
